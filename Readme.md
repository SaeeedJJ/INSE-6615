# NFT-Based Intellectual Property Management

## Introduction

The **NFT-Based Intellectual Property Management** project leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized, transparent, and secure system for managing intellectual property rights. Using NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), the project allows creators to tokenize their intellectual assets, such as art, music, and written works, while ensuring ownership authenticity and traceability.

This project employs Ethereumâ€™s ERC-721 standard for NFT creation and integrates access control mechanisms to safeguard assets. The solution provides creators with a reliable platform to mint, transfer, and manage their intellectual property rights, promoting innovation and reducing infringement risks.
